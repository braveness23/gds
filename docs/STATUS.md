## Critical Gaps

### ~~1. Timing/Synchronization~~ ✅ Implemented

`src/timing/ntp_clock.py` — NTPClock monitors offset against an NTP server and publishes TIMING events when drift exceeds `max_offset_ms` (default 10ms = 3.4m trilateration error). GPS PPS timing is handled at the OS level via chrony. See [GPS_PPS_TIMING.md](GPS_PPS_TIMING.md).

**Remaining:** Validate PPS hardware integration end-to-end on real Pi hardware.

### ~~2. System Monitoring~~ ✅ Implemented

`src/monitoring/system_monitor.py` — CPU, memory, disk, temperature monitoring via psutil. 314 lines, 86% test coverage.

### ~~3. Remote Configuration~~ ✅ Implemented

`src/remote_config/` — MQTT-based remote configuration with client/server architecture, safety checks (blocked paths, risk assessment), and HMAC-SHA256 message authentication. 2490 lines across 4 modules, 75-91% test coverage.

### 4. Test Coverage — ✅ Target Met

78%+ coverage (target: >70%). 396+ unit tests passing. Core components (event bus, config, detection, sensors) have >85% coverage.

### 5. ML Detection — Not Implemented

No ML detector class exists yet. Aubio onset detection works well as the primary detector and handles most gunshot events reliably.

## Deferred / Future Features

These were removed or never implemented. All are in git history or documented below.

### Machine Learning Detection

**Priority:** Medium | **Complexity:** High

ML-based gunshot classifier (PyTorch/TensorFlow/ONNX) with learned pattern recognition. Requires: training data, model architecture selection, feature extraction (MFCC/mel-spectrogram), inference pipeline optimized for Raspberry Pi.

Config keys: `detection.ml.enabled`, `detection.ml.model_path`

Consider Edge Impulse or TensorFlow Lite for embedded optimization.

### Meshtastic Output

**Priority:** Medium | **Complexity:** Medium

Mesh networking via Meshtastic LoRa radios for off-grid deployments without WiFi/cellular. Requires: `MeshtasticOutputNode`, serial/USB communication, channel configuration.

Config keys: `output.meshtastic.*`

Hardware: T-Beam, Heltec LoRa32. Python library: `meshtastic` (pip).

### LoRa Output

**Priority:** Low | **Complexity:** High

Direct LoRa radio with custom protocol. Consider Meshtastic instead unless custom protocol is required.

### Buffer Saver Output

**Priority:** High | **Complexity:** Low

Saves audio buffers around detections as WAV files with JSON metadata. Critical for debugging false positives and building ML training datasets.

Config keys: `output.buffer_saver.*`
Format: `{timestamp}_{node_id}_{event_id}.wav` + JSON sidecar

### I2S Raw Source

**Priority:** Medium | **Complexity:** Medium

Direct I2S interface audio capture bypassing ALSA for lower latency. A complete implementation existed (`src/audio/i2s_raw_source.py`) but was not wired to `main.py`. Code is preserved in git history.

Requires: config option `audio.source_type: "i2s"`, platform abstraction (Linux only), integration testing.

## Future Ideas

### Audio Filtering

**Priority:** Medium | **Complexity:** Low–Medium

Only a high-pass (low-cut) filter exists today (`src/processing/processing_nodes.py`). Additional filters would improve detection quality in noisy environments:

- **Low-pass filter** — cut high-frequency hiss/aliasing above the gunshot frequency range
- **Band-pass filter** — combine high-pass + low-pass into a single configurable passband (e.g. 200Hz–8kHz for gunshots)
- **Notch filter** — reject specific interference frequencies (e.g. 50/60Hz mains hum, HVAC tones)
- **Dynamic compression / AGC** — normalize signal level before detection so distant shots aren't missed and close shots don't saturate
- **Noise gate** — hard-gate signal below a noise floor to prevent false positives in windy/outdoor environments

Config keys (proposed): `processing.lowpass_filter.*`, `processing.bandpass_filter.*`, `processing.notch_filter.*`, `processing.compressor.*`

Implementation: all would follow the same pattern as `HighPassFilterNode` — scipy.signal butter/iirnotch, AudioNode subclass, config-driven enable/disable.
